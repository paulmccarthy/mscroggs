# Description

[mscroggs](https://www.mscroggs.co.uk/) runs a yearly puzzle competition. This repo contains code used to solve various puzzles and where no code was used a description of how the solution was found.

Many of the solutions are brute-force, so don't expect any elegence, or optimisation. I'm purely looking for a solution. Where I've used external resources, they'll be linked in the relevant README files.

Corrections are welcome, I'm not confident that all my answers are correct.

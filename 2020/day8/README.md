The residents of Octingham have 8 fingers. Instead of counting in base ten, they count in base eight: the digits of their numbers represent ones, eights, sixty-fours, two-hundred-and-fifty-sixes, etc instead of ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.

For example, a residents of Octingham would say 12, 22 and 52 instead of our usual numbers 10, 18 and 42.

Today's number is what a resident of Octingham would call 11 squared (where the 11 is also written using the Octingham number system).

0o11 = (1 * 8^1) + (1 * 8^0) = 9\
9 * 9 = 81 = 64 + 16 + 1 = (1 * 8^2) + (2 * 8^1) + (1 * 8^0) = 0o121

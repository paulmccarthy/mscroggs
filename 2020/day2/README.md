# Description
Carol draws a square with area 62. She then draws the smallest possible circle that this square is contained inside. Next, she draws the smallest possible square that her circle is contained inside. What is the area of her second square?

# Workings
1. The smallest possible circle will have a diameter equal to the diagonal of the square.
1. A square with area of 62 has a side of sqrt(62), and a diagonal of sqrt(124). (Pythagoras).
1. The smallest possible square around that circle will have sides of length equal to the diameter of the circle = sqrt(124).
1. Therefore the area of the square is 124.

# Description

[mscroggs](https://www.mscroggs.co.uk/) runs a yearly puzzle competition. This repo contains snippets of code used to solve various puzzles.

Many of the solutions are brute-force, so don't expect any elegence, or optimisation. I'm purely looking for a solution. Where I've used external resources, they'll be linked in the relevant README files.
